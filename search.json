Questions about the calculation of light rays' motion and the use of notches for comparison were also addressed. Date: [Date of the lecture] Key Concepts and Terminology: Isotropy: The property of being the same in all directions on a very large scale (a few hundred million light years). Example: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Homogeneity: The property of being the same at all places. When combined with isotropy, it implies uniformity. Comoving Coordinates: Coordinates where galaxies are at approximately constant values positioned by arbitrary coordinates/notches. Scale Factor (a(t)): The factor that describes how physical distance changes over time in the expanding universe, i.e., physical distance per coordinate distance that increases with time. Main Ideas and Themes: Properties of the Universe: The universe is isotropic and homogeneous on large scales, leading to uniformity. The universe was filled with plasma until about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, after which it cooled and formed neutral gas (recombination). Hubble’s Law and Age Estimation: Hubble’s Law was first measured by Georges Lemaître. Age estimation of the universe can be given by (1/H_0). Equations and Mathematical Concepts:Another expression of Hubble’s law: Redshift to scale factor: Please refer to xxxx Questions and Clarifications: Why do we not consider the effect of the expansion of the universe on the motion of light rays in this calculation? In special relativity, all inertial observers are equivalent. The “cannon” at which the light emits is also in this reference frame (the expanding universe). So it does not matter. How to synchronize clocks? Synchronization of clocks in one universe at different places (special relativity). Key assumption: universe is 100% homogeneous. Thus, if you live in galaxy A, the time taken for Hubble constant to change from A to B is X, which is the same if you live in other galaxies. Key: use a truth/fact such as the physical diameter of a hydrogen atom to synchronize clocks, since this diameter does not change by where you live. Need a factor that changes with time.

No, because there is no way to compare the arbitrary notches.","tags":["Note","Cosmology"]},{"title":"The Early Universe II","path":"/2024/07/17/The Early Universe (II)/","content":"Summary The lecture covered the anthropic principle, particularly in the context of vacuum energy density and the landscape of possible vacuum states. It discussed the selection effect as a potential explanation for why we observe such a low vacuum energy density, noting that while controversial, this explanation gains plausibility when other deterministic explanations fail. Date: [Date of the lecture] Key Concepts and Terminology: Anthropic Principle: The idea that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious life that observes it. Landscape: Refers to the multitude of possible vacuum states in string theory, estimated to be around 10^500. Vacuum Energy Density: The energy density of empty space, also known as dark energy, which influences the expansion of the universe. Main Ideas and Themes: Vacuum Energy Density and the Landscape: If the landscape has 10^500 vacua and a fraction 10^-120 have small vacuum energy densities like our universe, then we expect about 10^-120 × 10^500 = 10^380 vacua with low energy densities like ours. The question arises: why do we live in such a rare type of vacuum? Selection Effect: The local density of matter in which we find ourselves is about 10^30 times larger than the mean density of the visible universe. This could be due to a selection effect: life can evolve only in those rare regions of the universe where the density of matter is unusually high. Vacuum Energy Density Explanation: Steve Weinberg (1987) suggested that the vacuum energy density might be explained similarly. If the vacuum energy density is huge in most pocket universes, large and negative values would cause quick collapse, while large and positive values would prevent galaxy formation. Therefore, life can only arise if the vacuum energy density is very near zero. Martel, Shapiro, and Weinberg (1998) calculated that the vacuum energy density’s effect on galaxy formation aligns with what we measure, to within a factor of order 5. The Controversy: Criticism of Anthropic Arguments: Some physicists regard anthropic arguments as ridiculous. Anthropic explanations should be considered a last resort, used only when more deterministic explanations fail. For vacuum energy density, since other explanations seem inadequate, the selection-effect explanation becomes more attractive. This explanation is considered plausible but still debated, and it’s also applied to other quantities like the Higgs mass and the top quark mass.","tags":["Note","Cosmology"]},{"title":"The Early Universe I","path":"/2024/07/17/The Early Universe (I)/","content":"Summary The lecture introduced inflationary cosmology as an extension of the standard big bang theory. It discussed evidence supporting inflation, such as the uniformity and flatness problems, and explored the implications of inflation, including the concept of a multiverse. Key questions remain about the initial conditions and the nature of dark energy. The lecture also covered the limitations of the standard big bang model and how inflation theory addresses these gaps. Date: [Date of the lecture] Key Concepts and Terminology: Big Bang Theory: The universe began 13-14 billion years ago. It was initially a hot dense uniform soup of particles that filled space uniformly and expanded rapidly. Cosmic Inflation: A brief period of exponential expansion of the universe driven by a form of repulsive gravity. A “prequel” to the Big Bang. Dark Energy: A form of energy that causes the accelerated expansion of the universe. COBE-WMAP-Planck: Satellites that provided crucial data about the cosmic microwave background radiation supporting the Big Bang model. Main Ideas and Themes: Standard Big Bang Model: Explains how the early universe expanded and cooled, the formation of light chemical elements, and how matter formed stars, galaxies, and clusters. Limitations of Big Bang Model: Does not describe the cause of the expansion, the origin of matter, and events before the big bang. Cosmic Inflation Theory: Proposes a patch of repulsive gravity material in the early universe that drove exponential expansion which supplements the Big Bang theory. Where did the matter come from? General relativity and particle theories predict that high-energy forms of matter create gravitational repulsion through negative pressures. Inflation theory suggests that a tiny patch of this repulsive material caused exponential expansion in the early universe, doubling in size every 10^-37 seconds. This rapid expansion, lasting about 10^-35 seconds, ended when the material decayed, releasing energy that formed a hot dense “primordial soup” starting standard cosmology. Detailed Answer General relativity and modern particle theories predict that at very high energies, certain forms of matter can create gravitational repulsion through negative pressures. Inflation theory proposes that a small patch of this repulsive gravity material existed in the early universe. For inflation to occur at the grand unified theory scale (∼10^16 GeV), this patch only needed to be about 10^-28 cm in size. Although such patches would be extremely rare, inflation would magnify them enormously. The gravitational repulsion created by this material was the driving force behind the big bang, causing the universe to double in size every 10^-37 seconds. This patch expanded exponentially by at least a factor of 10^28 (around 100 doublings) and possibly more. Inflation lasted about 10^-35 seconds, at the end of which the region that would become the observable universe was about the size of a marble. The repulsive-gravity material was unstable and decayed like a radioactive substance, ending inflation. This decay released energy, producing ordinary particles and forming a hot, dense \"primordial soup,\" marking the beginning of standard cosmology. However, the decay did not occur uniformly everywhere, leading to the concept of eternal inflation. Despite the expansion, the density of the repulsive gravity material did not decrease. As more mass and energy appeared during the expansion, the total energy remained conserved due to the negative energy of the gravitational field balancing the positive energy of the repulsive gravity material What caused the expansion? The positive energy of the repulsive gravity material was compensated by the negative energy of gravity. The total energy of the universe may very well be zero. Flatness Problem The early universe was remarkably flat, meaning it followed Euclidean geometry. In general relativity, this flatness is related to the universe’s mass density (Ω). For the universe to appear flat today, Ω had to be extremely close to 1 just after the big bang. Inflation drives Ω towards 1 very rapidly regardless of its initial value. Observations by the Planck satellite show Ω = 1.0010 ± 0.0065. The discovery of dark energy, which has accelerated the universe’s expansion for the last 5 billion years, further supports this. Uniformity Large Scale Uniformity: The cosmic background radiation is uniform in temperature to one part in 100,000, which was released when the universe was about 400,000 years old. Standard cosmology cannot explain this uniformity without requiring information to travel at 100 times the speed of light. Inflation solves this by proposing the universe began very small, allowing uniformity to be established easily and then stretched to its current size. Small Scale Nonuniformity: The cosmic background radiation is mostly uniform, but small ripples exist at a level of 1 part in 100,000. Inflation attributes these ripples to quantum fluctuations, making precise predictions about their spectrum which align well with observed data. Equations and Mathematical Concepts: Gravitational Repulsion: In general relativity, gravitational repulsion is created by negative pressures. Critical Density (Ω): Ω = actual mass density / critical mass density. The universe’s flatness corresponds to Ω = 1. Exponential Expansion: The repulsive-gravity material caused the universe to double in size every 10^-37 seconds. Questions and Clarifications: What caused the initial conditions leading to inflation? Why is gravity repulsive in this context? What is the nature of dark energy driving current expansion? Why did the universe continue to expand after inflation?","tags":["Note","Cosmology"]},{"title":"About me","path":"/about/index.html","content":"Welcome to my blog!
